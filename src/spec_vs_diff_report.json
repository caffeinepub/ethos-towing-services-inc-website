  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all 11 requirements (REQ-95 through REQ-105). The ETRMembership component was created with all specified feature cards, pricing display, and proper integration into App.tsx. Chatbot responses were updated to include ETR Everyday membership information. However, REQ-97 has a minor discrepancy: the feature card heading is '24/7 roadside assistance' instead of the required '247 service' heading.",
